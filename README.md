## Roadmap

- Monitoring specific hashtags and pulling over most recent tweets and save the text data  any images (ignore videos), and the engagement stats i.e likes, retweets, quote tweets, comments into a database.

- We want to be able to view these datasets with filtering options on a front-end.
- We want to monitor some specific accounts through KOL data collection.
- We will be able to add new accounts through front-end.
- We should also be able to add target words i.e “ Pull the post data if the post contains..” via the web portal that meets the required criterea.
- Essential APi posting , Follow and RT : Using the essential api for twitter, make sure that through our own rest api we can post, follow and retweet on command
